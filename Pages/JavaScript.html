  <div class="overview">
    <p><span class="white-text">JavaScript is a versatile</span>, high-level programming language that plays a pivotal role in modern web development. Initially designed to add interactive elements to websites, it has evolved into a powerful tool for building complex web applications.</p>
    <p>Along with HTML and CSS, JavaScript is essential to front-end web development. A majority of the web’s most popular sites, from Facebook and Twitter to Gmail and YouTube, rely on JavaScript to create interactive web pages and dynamically display content to users.</p>
    <p>Due to its flexibility, JavaScript has many possible applications. Although it’s primarily a front-end language run on the browser, it can be used on the server-side through Node.js to build scalable network applications. Node.js is compatible with Linux, SunOS, Mac OS X, and Windows. Through the use of specialized frameworks, like React Mobile and Electron, JavaScript can also be used for mobile app and desktop software development.</p>

      <span class="white-text">JavaScript Frameworks and Libraries:</span> React and Vue.js, Each of these frameworks and libraries brings unique strengths to the table, catering to different needs in the development of interactive web applications.<br><br>
      <span class="white-text">React:</span> A versatile library developed by Facebook, React is renowned for its component-based architecture, allowing for the creation of efficient and interactive user interfaces.<br><br>
      <span class="white-text">Vue.js:</span> Vue.js stands out for its simplicity and flexibility, making it a popular choice for developers looking to build dynamic user interfaces, especially due to its gradual learning curve and ease of integration.

      <span class="white-text">JavaScript Environments:</span> Beyond Browsers to Servers and More, JavaScript, traditionally a browser-based language, has expanded its reach to various environments:<br><br>
      <span class="white-text">Browsers:</span> Initially designed for web browsers, JavaScript is the scripting language that enables interactive web pages, working in all modern browsers without any additional installation.<br><br>
      <span class="white-text">Node.js:</span> Marking JavaScript's foray into server-side development, Node.js is a runtime environment that allows JavaScript to run outside of a browser. This has revolutionized web development, enabling full-stack development with a single programming language.
