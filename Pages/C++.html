    <p><span class="white-text">C++ is a portable</span>, object-oriented language that can be adapted to multiple platforms. It was designed with systems programming and resource-constrained software in mind. While based on C, C++ has some major differences.</p>
    <p>C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs. C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms. It’s historically been used to develop general software, such as applications and has it’s uses in scientific computing.</p>
    <p>As C++ is an extension of C, it contains all the features of C, such as portability, rich library, structured programming, pointer, memory management, etc. Being a compiler-based language, C++ executes the code faster, than most non compiler-based languages.</p>

      <span class="white-text">C++ Environments:</span> From Machine learning to Unreal Engine, C++ can be used for both lower level programming and writing high level applications, such as video games. The fast execution time allows for highly optimized graphics at a relatively low cost, compared to most other languages.<br><br>
      <span class="white-text">Machine Learning:</span> Along with Python, C++ has it’s uses in Machine learning, the high speed of compiled code make it suitable for high-performance computing and training neural networks.<br><br>
      <span class="white-text">Unreal Engine:</span> Chosen for it’s excellent memory allocation and overall stable nature, and great flexibility cross-platforms.

      <span class="white-text">C++ Frameworks and libraries:</span> : Beyond simple computer applications, C++ has libraries and frameworks for almost all tasks possible. For example end-to-end encryption and databases for large systems.<br><br>
      <span class="white-text">SQLite:</span> Is a full-featured and self contained SQL database engine. It’s the most used database engine in the world and therefore used extensively. As it’s in the public domain, using it for private or commercial purposes<br><br>
      <span class="white-text">OpenSSL:</span> The Swiss army knife of cryptography. It’s commercial grade, full-featured toolkit for general-purpose cryptography and secure communications have been used for E-mail systems and web servers.

  <div class="exampletext">
    <p><span class="white-text">Explanation: </span>This is an example of a simple "Hello world!" program. In this example, the #include &lt;iostream> let's us have the ability to output (or take input) from the console. And int main() is the function where the code starts running from.</p>

  <img class="examples" src="Data/C++_IMG/sum.png" alt="Hello world"> <!-- https://carbon.now.sh/ -->
  <div class="exampletext">
    <p><span class="white-text">Explanation: </span>This example adds together 2 inputted numbers and then outputs the stored sum. In this example std namespace is included to make code more readable. </p>
  </div>

  <img class="examples" src="Data/C++_IMG/function.png" alt="Hello world"> <!-- https://carbon.now.sh/ -->
  <div class="exampletext">
    <p><span class="white-text">Explanation: </span>This example creates a function that takes in an argument and then outputs it.</p>

  <div class="exampletext">
    <p><span class="white-text">Explanation: </span>This example is about making a object in C++. The object is and "animal" that has 2 variables for name and age. With a bulit in function to output the object data.</p>

  <div class="exampletext">
    <p><span class="white-text">Explanation: </span>This example introduces a user-defined data type "Point" that has 2 integers holding the data of x and y position. Struct is different from a class.</p>
