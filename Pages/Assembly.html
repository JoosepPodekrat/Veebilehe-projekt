  <div class="overview">
    <p><span class="white-text">Assembly is the lowest level coding language, one step above machine code.</span> Known for itâ€™s high level of optimization and high degree of control over the computer. At itâ€™s core, Assembly is binary code written in a format that humans can read. The assembler takes that abstraction and reverts it back in to the corresponding bit code.</p>
    <p>Although most interpreted languages compile into assembly, writing code in assembly itself shines mostly in the creation of drivers, compilers and extremely light-weight programs. A majority of the worldâ€™s drivers and assemblers are written in Assembly.</p>
    <p>Due to itâ€™s nature as a package of multiple, processor-dependant languages, itâ€™s used in virtually everything electronic. Although itâ€™s primarily used in writing extremely low-level code, it can be used to to write fully working large systems. Some higher level as  When optimized for the hardware, itâ€™s compatible with everything, from missile guidance chips to phone processors.</p>

      <span class="white-text">The Internet:  NASM</span> or Netwide Assembler is the assembler for easy networking between modems and routers. It has made writing code for essentially bare metal extremely easy.<br><br>
      <span class="white-text">Space travel: HAL/S</span> or High-Order Assembly Language/Shuttle was an assembler written to be easily accessible to people unfamiliar with coding, such as astronauts.

      <span class="white-text">x86</span> is the most commonly used language, that runs on Intel-based processors. Itâ€™s used extensively for device drivers, system programming and other low-level tasks.<br><br>
